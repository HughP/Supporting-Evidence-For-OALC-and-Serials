# Research on Journals and Articles in OLAC

This repo contains several components.

1. At least nine examples of records in OLAC which are about or reference Articles.
2. Screenshots of the list of OLAC data providers which are positive for the full text search terms "article" or "journal" along with counts of each term.
3. A CSV file which contains the tabulation, notes, and a general characterization of findings per term per archive. E.g., sometimes article in linguistics referes to a part of grammar, rather than a type of publication.
4. A folder of proposed OLAC record templates for the model presented in the talk. (At the time of the presentation these were not complete, but will be prior to article publication). Currently there are two ways to overtly declare an record type, the first is by creating a record profile and then making a set of assumptions on the basies of the presence or absence of those elements, the second is to use the Dublin Core "conformsTo" element and link (using a URI) to a specific thing specification. The nature of the conformacy may be ambigious, but if a controled vocabulary were published for Journal, Volume, Issue, Article, etc. and each value given a URI then if the conformacy to the value in the vocabualry infers that the object type is indeed the thing linked to.
